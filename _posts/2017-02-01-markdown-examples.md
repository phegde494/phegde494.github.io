I am currently a freshman at Northeastern University majoring in Computer Science seeking internships in software engineering and quantitative trading for Summer 2023. In the past, I've developed software at a **startup**, managed **infrastructure deployment** at a larger company, and cooked up **ML models** for a consulting firm. I hope to explore new opportunities and landscapes in the years to come!
