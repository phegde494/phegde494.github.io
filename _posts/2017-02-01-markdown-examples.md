I am currently a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign majoring in Computer Science in the Grainger College of Engineering seeking internships in software engineering and quantitative trading for Summer 2024. In the past, I've developed software at a **startup**, managed **infrastructure deployment** and optimized code for **operating systems** and **networks** at two larger companies, and cooked up **ML models** for a consulting firm. I hope to explore new opportunities and landscapes in the years to come!
