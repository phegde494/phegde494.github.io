I am currently a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign majoring in Computer Science in the Grainger College of Engineering seeking internships in software engineering and quantitative trading for Summer 2025. I recently interned at **[Databricks]([url](https://www.databricks.com/))**, where I worked on building performant, scalable infrastructure for the [Unity Catalog]([url](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog)). I have significant experience and interest in machine learning, high-performance systems, operating systems, networks, and databases. Feel free to reach out via the contact channels below!
