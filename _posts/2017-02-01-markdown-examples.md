I am currently a freshman at Northeastern University majoring in Computer Science seeking internships in software engineering and quantitative trading for Summer 2023. In the past, I've developed software at a **startup**, managed **infrastructure deployment** at a larger company, and cooked up **ML models** for a consulting firm. I hope to explore new opportunities and landscapes in the years to come!

## Code

Source code can be included by fencing the code with three backticks. Syntax highlighting works automatically when specifying the language after the backticks.

````
```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
````

This would be rendered as:

```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
